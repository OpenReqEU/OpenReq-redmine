# OpenReq-redmine

We provide two demo showcasing Redmine integrations of the oraw (OpenReq-AlterWay) algorithms. The first one is pre-configured and the second one can be integrated in your own solution.

## pre-configured demo

For quick testing purpose, this version of the demo is already configured.

Clone this repository with his submodules.

```bash
git clone https://git.rnd.alterway.fr/overboard/openreq/oraw3_missing-features
cd oraw3_missing-features
```

Copy `SentiStrengthCom.jar` in `oraw2_issue-weight/scikit-sentistrength`. Note that sentistrength.jar is not included in this repository since it's proprietary software, please refer to [this](http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/) site.

```bash
cp ??? oraw2_issue-weight/scikit-sentistrength/SentiStrengthCom.jar
```

Log in to our GitLabâ€™s Container Registry:

```bash
docker login hub.rnd.alterway.fr
```

Launch the demo

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

From there you should be able to connect to [Redmine](localhost:3000).

The default username is `admin` and the password is `password`.

You can create a new issue in the preconfigured project "test1". Issue samples are provided in the samples directory.

The newly created issues are automatically classified with 3 fields:

- Category: Demand, Anomaly, Human
- Urgence: Basse, Normale, Haute
- ponderation: The higher is the priority

And related tickets will be linked at the bottom.

## From raw images

Launch the demo with the following command instead:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.raw.yml up
```

Create the initial configuration of your Redmine instance, please refer to [redmine.org](https://redmine.org) for additional documentation.

Be sure to add 3 custom field and to activate them in the concerned projects:

- Category a list with 3 possible values Demand, Anomaly and Human
- Urgence a list with 3 possible values Basse, Normale and Haute
- ponderation a float

Then configure the ponderation plugin ([README](redmine-ponderation-plugin/README.md)).

In the qualification plugin map the custom fields with the oraw3 service:

```text
Categorie   http://oraw3:8081/tracker
Urgence     http://oraw3:8081/urgence
```

Configure the advise plugin with the followin settings:

```text
advise server url                               http://oraw5:8000/getClosestTicket
Advise confidence treshold                      0.6
Max issue returned                              3
Email of the user associated with the advises   admin@example.net
```

Finally, activate `advise`, `auto qualification` and `auto ponderation` modules in the projects of your choice.
